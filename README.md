SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.
Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. 
    
Software Architecture
1. Monolithic Architecture
2. Service Oriented Architecture (Micro services)
3. Service Based Architecture (5G)

A Monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program. Monolithic means composed all in one piece.In a tightly-coupled architecture, each component and its associated components must be present in order for code to be executed or compiled.

     
		      USER INTERFACE   -------> LOGIC ------> DATA INTERFACE  -------> DATEBASE 
					
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies.	
  
Service-Based Architecture (SBA), whereby the control plane functionality and common data repositories of a 5G network are delivered by way of a set of interconnected Network Functions (NFs), each with authorization to access each other's services
 
 <strong>How to deploy websites</strong>
 
Purchase a Domain Name 
(If you are new you need to do is register a domain name.)
 
After building the Website/Project its time for deployment. Generally we are using Cloud Service for hosting the website on the Server.
Examples of cloud services include online data storage and backup solutions, Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document collaboration services, database processing, managed technical support services and more.
With help of Cloud Service we get the fixed IP address (Public IP address) and another services which is important for website.
IP Address ---> 1.Private IP address  2.Public IP address

*Note :-Local host /127.0.0.1.( Private IP address)

Cloud Service Provider
 Amazon Web Services(AWS),
 Microsoft Azure ,
 Digital Ocean,
 IBM Cloud,
 Rackspace,
 Go Daddy etc;
 
 CI/CD( Continous Integration Continous Deployment)
 
  A CI/CD pipeline helps you to automate step in your software delivery process,such as initialing code builds,running automated tests,and deploying to a production enviiroment.Automated pipelines remove manaul errors,provide standardized development feedback loops and enable fast product iterations.
	
CI,short for Continous Integration, is a software development practice in which all developers merge code changes in a central repository multiple times a day. CD stand for Continous Integration adds the practice os=f automating the entire software release process.
With CI, each change in code trigger an automated build and test sequences foe the given code.
CD includes infrastructure provisioning and deployment ,which may be manual ansd consist of multiple stages. What's important is that all these processes are fully automated with each run fully logged and visible to the entire team .

DevOps -(Development + Operations). is how modren developers are builing great products by using new methods of Continuous Integration,Continuous Delivery,(CI/CD) and Continuous Deployment.Most teams have automated processes to check in code and deploy to new environment.
